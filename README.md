> We are using the fake API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, so this value is hardcoded in [/src/App.tsx](./src/App.tsx).

> You can use other data sources but keep in mind the return type should be the same as declared in [/src/types/index.ts](./src/types/index.ts) (User type)

## Running tests

We have some tests written using Vitest.

For a single run execute the command
```sh
npm run test
```

For the watch mode execute the command
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
